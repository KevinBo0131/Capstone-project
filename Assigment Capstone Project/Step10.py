# STEP 10
# Visual and Statistic Correlation analysis for selection of best features.

# First step is to creat a dot plot graph for each attribute. 
# The goal is to choose the best columns(Features) which are correlated to the Target variable (Price).

# The reason to creat dot plot is to seek for any trends. 
# As a result, there is no *clear* trend as they all seem to be at any price with any specs. 
# Except, Storage_Capacity. From the plot we can clearly see as the storage capacity increase the price value also increases substantially and more visable. 
# Every other attributes seem to be the opposite, even if processor speed is on the higher end, between 3.5 - 4.0, the price of the laptop can still be on the cheaper end. 
# That also applies to Ram_Size, Screen_size and weight. 
# Storage capacity has the highest correlation.

# Statistical Feature Selection
# The following code creates a graph of a correlation matrix.

# Column order
df = df[['Price', 'Brand', 'Processor_Speed', 'RAM_Size', 'Storage_Capacity', 'Screen_Size', 'Weight']]

# Remove non-numeric columns
df_numeric = df.drop(columns=['Brand'])

# Calculate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df_numeric.corr()

# Plot correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

# Due to the low correlation numbers, any correlation greater or equals to Â±0.05 will be considered as significant
# These are the results...
# Price: 1 (Very Significant)
# Processor_speed: -0.05 (Significant)
# RAM_Size: 0.06 (Significant)
# Storage_Capacity: 1 (Very Significant)
# Screen_Size: -0.03 (NOT Significant)
# Weight: 0.04 (NOT Significant)

# So the final selected features are Storage_Capacity, RAM_Size, Processor_speed.
